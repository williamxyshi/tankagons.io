# tankagons.io
a game worked on by me and masea3439

Tasks completed:

-Multiplayer support
-basic body sprites
-player disconnecting
-player centered movement
-shooting
-mouse tracking
-login page
-hitboxes(bullet to tank)
-HITBOX MISALIGNED WITH WHATS ACTUALLY ON THE TANK
-minimap
-refined hitbox

TODO in terms of priority:

-added a healthbar except it does not update

-bullet to tree collision

-physics engine for collisions
-art (alphabet and icons)


Physics Engine plan::
2 cases: a collision with the side of the tank or a collision with a vertex of the tank
For the side of tank, calculate the perpendicular bisector the edge of the tank makes with the center of the circle




Backlog:

-minimap
-better art (trees + more tanks)
-hitboxes(tank to tank and tank to tree and bullet to tree etc)
-physics engine
-classes
-more weapon types (missles with pathfinding)

Spawn into a procedurely generated map and fight other players for domination. Protect your spawnpoint while destroying those of your enemies. Farm mobs to increase in strength.
