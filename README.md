# tankagons.io
a game worked on by me and masea3439

An online multiplayer FFA tank game. Modeled after popular browser game Diep.IO, except we're implementing base building and more dynamic enemies

Planned Features:

-added a healthbar except it does not update

-bullet to tree collision

-physics engine for collisions
-art (alphabet and icons)

Current Features:

  -Multiplayer support
  
  -basic body sprites
  
  -player disconnecting
  
  -player centered movement
  
  -shooting
  
  -mouse tracking
  
  -login page
  
  -hitboxes(bullet to tank)
  
  -HITBOX MISALIGNED WITH WHATS ACTUALLY ON THE TANK
  
  -minimap
  
  -refined hitbox



Backlog:

-minimap
-better art (trees + more tanks)
-hitboxes(tank to tank and tank to tree and bullet to tree etc)
-physics engine
-classes
-more weapon types (missles with pathfinding)

Spawn into a procedurely generated map and fight other players for domination. Protect your spawnpoint while destroying those of your enemies. Farm mobs to increase in strength.
